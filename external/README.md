The following external dependencies have been included in this repository for convenience:

* websocketpp v0.7.0 from https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp/tree/0.7.0 (custom permissive licence)
* pthreads v1.0.1 from http://pstreams.sourceforge.net/ (boost licence)
* ASIO standalone v1.12.1 from https://think-async.com/ (boost licence)
* Clara v1.0 from https://github.com/philsquared/Clara (BSD 2 license)

In some cases a lot of the unused parts have been stripped out (e.g. the 25M ASIO doc directory).
